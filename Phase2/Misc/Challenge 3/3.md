# Challenge 3
## Challenge Description
```
My friend sent me this weird text. I am not sure whether this is an SOS message or if he is trolling me.  Help me decode this.
```
## <span style="color:aqua;">Analysis</span>
In this challenge there was a data.txt file given which includes a series of emojis.At first glace the first letter of each emoji was giving a meaningful output but it was not close to the required flag format which was **flag{.*}** so after messing around it for days I googled the emoji and found a encryption method using emoji called **WINGDING** so i translated the emojis and found out the flag!
