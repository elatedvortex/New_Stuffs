## Challenge Description
```
I heard that there are is no official strings for windows and I love Windows!
So I asked my hacker friend to give me his forged copy for strings. But he reminded me that he intercepted from other hackers which have intercepted it from others and that from others… I don’t know how many times it was intercepted but it works! I have tested it on my Windows and it works like a charm!

## <span style="color:aqua;">Analysis</span>
As the name of the file suggests i.e.**strings.exe**
 I immediately analyzed the strings of the file and found out a secret line encoded with base 64 at the end of the program. I then decoded it and found a link to a gist page.Analyzing this file took a lot of efforts I tried converting the ascii and removing the patterns and all but after sometimes I figured out that this could be converted into the octal code and then I again got the code as a base 64. So i again decoded it which didnt give a meaningful result.Only after using **Cyberchef** I was able to decode it that it was required to render the image so after rendering the image an QR code was unveiled and after scanning the code the flag was captured.
