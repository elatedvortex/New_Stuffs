# Challenge 2
## Challenge Description
```
Figure out what my friend is typing in his special keyboard
```
## <span style="color:aqua;">Analysis</span>
It was easily founded that it was a hexadecimal code and after decoding it it was random words which was meaningless so from the given hint I tried using 
* Clipher Keyboard
* Clipher Substitution 
* Dvorak Keyboard 
* Keyboard Shift Cipher

and other decryptions but nothing made sense and I couldn't find any flag
